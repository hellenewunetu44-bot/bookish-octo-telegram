Around 97% of the town’s residents practice Orthodox Christianity, which means the church plays a central role in daily life and cultural identity. </p>

<p>🛕 Churches as Community Hubs
Churches like Abema Mariam are more than places for Sunday worship:</p>
<p>They host daily prayers, festivals, and holy day celebrations (especially for saints like Mary — e.g., Hidar Zion, Nehase 16, Meskel feasts related to the Virgin).</p>

Local traditional activities like edir and ekub often form around church communities, strengthening social bonds beyond just worship.</p>
